This APP is related to listing of all the latest trending movies. I've developed this app using the programmatic approach with UIKit by completely removing the main.storyboard file. I've Implemented infinite scroll for fetching the movies efficiently from the network. This app is developed in MVC and I havn't used any third party libraries as I implemented custom image caching. I've also made the App testible by writing test cases for Image cache and Network manager. I've used MockData to test my NetworkManager so that even if there is some problem with the backend, my test case don't crash.
